Android CRUD Code Generator
===========================

For completely crud application we need entity classes, db helper class or content provider, dao classes and basic generated activities for manipulating the data. For that reason i came with idea to implement simple crud code generator which will generate crud application based on simple xml definition on entity classes, and then Android CRUD Code Generator is born.

Android CRUD Code Generator contains 5 different generators, Activity Generator, Dao Generator, DBHelper Generator, Entity Generator and Service Generator.

DBHelper Generator generate dbhelper class that is used for creating application database. Generated DBHelper class is singleton class for better reusing on database connection. Entity Generator generate entity classes with getters and setters for every database table defined in xml definition file. Dao Generator generate basic crud operations for every entity class in classical DAO way, separated implementations from interfaces. Every DAO implementation is also singleton class.

Activity Generator is in process.

In second phase there are plans for implementing simple DSL that will be written in XML definition file and from which specific code will be generated by Service Generator.
